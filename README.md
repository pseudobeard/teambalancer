# teambalancer

This is a quick and dirty hack in the form of a Discord bot for
balancing scrim teams in Overwatch.

## How to Use

Edit players.txt with BattleNet IDs, e.g., `ASnackyBeard#1234`,
one per line.

Run `python balance.py` and it will generate two roughly balanced teams.

## TODOs

- Weight teams by SR
- Weight teams by role
