# teambalancer

This is a quick and dirty hack in the form of a Discord bot for
balancing scrim teams in Overwatch.

## Initial Setup (Windows)

Edit SETUP.bat (Right click -> Edit) to provide the correct path to python pip - This is usually located in `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Programs\Python36\Scripts` or `C:\Python34\Scripts`. Ensure this directory contains pip.exe.

The bat file should look like the following:
`C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Programs\Python36\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt`

Save changes and close SETUP.bat.

Run SETUP.bat and leave to install required modules.

To setup streamelements importing, edit getter.py and change jwtToken and id to match those of your streamelements store.
These can be found at https://streamelements.com/dashboard/account/information. change ITEM_NAME to match the name of
the item viewers can redeem to participate

## How to Use - Standalone Code

You will need Python 3.

Run "balance.py" to run the code.

The available commands will be listed.

## How to Use - Discord Bot

You will need Python 3.5 or greater.

Run `python scrimbot.py` and allow the bot to startup. Use the folling commands in discord:

  `listplayers {all}` - List active players. Add "all" argument to include inactive players.
  
  `update {players}` - Update players stats. For example `update ASnackyBeard#1234 ExamplePlayer#9876`
  
  `activate {players}` - Set listed players as active. For example `activate ASnackyBeard#1234 ExamplePlayer#9876`
  
  `retire {players}` - Set listed players as inactive. For example `retire ASnackyBeard#1234 ExamplePlayer#9876`
  
  `retireall` - Retire all active players (set all players as inactive)
  
  `playerstats {player}` - Show stats for specified player
  
  `updatesr {player} {new SR}` - Manually update SR for specified player. For example `updatesr ASnackyBeard#1234 3000`
  
  `autobalance {weight}`- Generate two balanced teams from active players. For example `autobalance flat`
  
  `tourney {weight}` - Generate balanced teams of 6 from active players. For example `tourney curve`
  
  `randomMap {--no2CP}` - Generate a random map. Using `--no2CP` will prevent a 2CP map being picked.
